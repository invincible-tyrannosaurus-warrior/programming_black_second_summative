Aims for building up skills for using React

Project plan: Building Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with React
To learn and apply React skills by enhancing an existing GitHub project or creating a web app, (potentially an online game, as a Progressive Web App)

Following Steps (if we agree to work on this topic)
1.Create github repository: to track our progress and challenges. Regular updates and logs are needed and records on how much we got further on this topic compares to (e.g last week)
2.After around two weeks we should be able to use React for developing web app. So the next step is to decide whether we do our own game or we enhance other peopleâ€™s work. (depends on our will and how good we are at that point. Should be decide later)

We believe it would be better to talk about the following steps later on. Same for the role assignment, we decide to assign different parts of the work based on our interests after getting more familiar with React and other related concepts.
The project should be around 4 weeks and 20hrs in total.
Frequently add up lastest learning logs and write down some notes on what each of us has done and chanllenges we've met. (work count of each log should be around 300-400 words).
